# Pet Care Reminder App

This app was created for my final project. It's an app that has multiple features designed to provide pet parents with all the tools they need to take care of their furry friend in one convenient place. Some of the features include:
* Feeding Instructions
* Medication Instructions
* Exercise Tracker
* Weight Tracker
* Health Tracker
* Stool Tracker
* Medical Tracker
* Services Page
* Calendar 

## Svelte

I chose to use Svelte as my framework because I really enjoyed working within this framework for one of our To Do assignments. I also have heard that it's up and coming in the industry and Thor teaches it in one of his classes so I thought it would be a good idea to start learning it now.
